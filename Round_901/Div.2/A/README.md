# A. Jellyfish and Undertale

### Limit
time limit per test: 1 second

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### Problem
Flowey has planted a bomb in Snowdin!

The bomb has a timer that is initially set to b
. Every second, the timer will decrease by 1
. When the timer reaches 0
, the bomb will explode! To give the residents of Snowdin enough time to evacuate, you will need to delay the bomb from exploding for as long as possible.

You have n
 tools. Each tool can only be used at most once. If you use the i
-th tool, the timer will increase by xi
. However, if the timer is changed to an integer larger than a
, the timer will be set to a
 due to a bug.

More specifically, the following events will happen every second in the following order:

1. You will choose some (possibly none) of your tools that have not been used before. If you choose the i
-th tool, and the bomb's timer is currently set to c
, the timer will be changed to min(c+xi,a)
.
2. The timer decreases by 1
.
3. If the timer reaches 0
, the bomb explodes.

Jellyfish now wants to know the maximum time in seconds until the bomb explodes if the tools are used optimally.

### Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤2000
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a
, b
 and n
 (1≤b≤a≤109
, 1≤n≤100
) — the maximum value of the bomb's timer, the initial value of the timer of the bomb and the number of tools.

The second line of each test contains n
 integers x1,x2,…,xn
 (1≤xi≤109
) — the number the timer can increase by using the i
-th tool.

Note that the sum of n
 over all test cases is not bounded.

### Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum time in seconds until the bomb explodes.
