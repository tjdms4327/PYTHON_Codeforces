# C. Clock Conversion

### Limit
time limit per test: 1 second

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### Problem
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour format.

- 24-hour format divides the day into 24 hours from 00
 to 23
, each of which has 60 minutes from 00
 to 59
.
- 12-hour format divides the day into two halves: the first half is AM
, and the second half is PM
. In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12,01,02,03,…,11
. Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00
 to 59
.

### Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤1440
) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s
 of length 5
 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour from 00
 to 23
, and mm represents the minute from 00
 to 59
.

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

### Output
For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not remove leading zeroes.
