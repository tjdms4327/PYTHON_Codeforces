# A. Euclid, Sequence and Two Numbers

### Limit
time limit per test: 1 second

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### Problem
We define a Euclid algorithm sequence of length k
 (k≥2
) for two positive integers x≥y
 as the following sequence of positive integers:

- a1,a2,…,ak
, where a1=x
, a2=y
, and for any i
 (1≤i≤k−2
), the equality ai+2=(aimodai+1)
 holds∗
.

For example, for x=13,y=8,k=4
, the corresponding Euclid algorithm sequence is a=[13,8,5,3]
. (a3=13mod8=5
, a4=8mod5=3
).

You are given a sequence b1,b2,…,bn
. You need to determine whether it is possible to permute its elements so that it becomes a Euclid algorithm sequence for some two positive integers x≥y
.

∗
xmody
 denotes the remainder when x
 is divided by y
.

### Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤500
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n
 (2≤n≤100
) — the size of the sequence.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers b1,b2,…,bn
 (1≤bi≤109
) — the sequence b
.

### Output
For each test case, if it is possible to permute the elements of sequence b
 so that there exists a suitable pair of positive integers x≥y
, output x,y
 on a separate line. Otherwise, output −1
 on a separate line.

If there are several suitable pairs x,y
, you may output any of them.
