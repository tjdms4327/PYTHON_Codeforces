# B. Palindrome, Twelve and Two Terms

### Limit
time limit per test: 1.5 seconds

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### Problem
You are given a positive integer n
. A pair of non-negative integers a,b
 is called beautiful if the following conditions hold:

- a+b=n
.
- The number a
 is a palindrome.∗
- The number b
 is divisible by 12
.

You need to find a beautiful pair or report that it does not exist.

∗
A number is called a palindrome if and only if it remains the same when its digits (in decimal notation) are written in reverse order. For example, the numbers 12321
, 6776
, 5
, 0
 are palindromes, while the numbers 123
 and 69
 — are not.

### Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤1018
).

### Output
For each test case, if such a
 and b
 exist, output a
 and b
 on a separate line, separated by a space. Otherwise, output −1
 on a separate line.

If there are several beautiful pairs a,b
, you may output any of them.
