# B. Team Training

### LIMIT
time limit per test: 2 seconds

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### PROBLEM
At the IT Campus "NEIMARK", there are training sessions in competitive programming — both individual and team-based!

For the next team training session, n
 students will attend, and the skill of the i
-th student is given by a positive integer ai
.

The coach considers a team strong if its strength is at least x
. The strength of a team is calculated as the number of team members multiplied by the minimum skill among the team members.

For example, if a team consists of 4
 members with skills [5,3,6,8]
, then the team's strength is 4⋅min([5,3,6,8])=12
.

Output the maximum possible number of strong teams, given that each team must have at least one participant and every participant must belong to exactly one team.

### Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and x
 (1≤n≤2⋅105
, 1≤x≤109
) — the number of students in training and the minimum strength of a team to be considered strong.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers ai
 (1≤ai≤109
) — the skill of each student.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

### Output
For each test case, output the maximum possible number of teams with strength at least x
.
