# A. Forbidden Integer

### Limit
time limit per test: 2 seconds

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### Problem
You are given an integer n
, which you want to obtain. You have an unlimited supply of every integer from 1
 to k
, except integer x
 (there are no integer x
 at all).

You are allowed to take an arbitrary amount of each of these integers (possibly, zero). Can you make the sum of taken integers equal to n
?

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

### Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤100
) — the number of testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains three integers n,k
 and x
 (1≤x≤k≤n≤100
).

### Output
For each test case, in the first line, print "YES" or "NO" — whether you can take an arbitrary amount of each integer from 1
 to k
, except integer x
, so that their sum is equal to n
.

If you can, the second line should contain a single integer m
 — the total amount of taken integers. The third line should contain m
 integers — each of them from 1
 to k
, not equal to x
, and their sum is n
.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
