### Limit
time limit per test: 1 second

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### Problem
Given an array a
 of length n
, containing integers. And there are two initially empty arrays b
 and c
. You need to add each element of array a
 to exactly one of the arrays b
 or c
, in order to satisfy the following conditions:

Both arrays b
 and c
 are non-empty. More formally, let lb
 be the length of array b
, and lc
 be the length of array c
. Then lb,lc≥1
.
For any two indices i
 and j
 (1≤i≤lb,1≤j≤lc
), cj
 is not a divisor of bi
.
Output the arrays b
 and c
 that can be obtained, or output −1
 if they do not exist.

### Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤500
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (2≤n≤100
) — the length of array a
.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤109
) — the elements of array a
.

### Output
For each test case, output a single integer −1
 if a solution does not exist.

Otherwise, in the first line, output two integers lb
 and lc
 — the lengths of arrays b
 and c
 respectively.

In the second line, output lb
 integers b1,b2,…,blb
 — the elements of array b
.

In the third line, output lc
 integers c1,c2,…,clc
 — the elements of array c
.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them. You can output the elements of the arrays in any order.
