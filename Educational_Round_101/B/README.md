# B. Red and Blue

### LIMIT
time limit per test: 2 seconds

memory limit per test: 512 megabytes

### PROBLEM
Monocarp had a sequence a
 consisting of n+m
 integers a1,a2,…,an+m
. He painted the elements into two colors, red and blue; n
 elements were painted red, all other m
 elements were painted blue.

After painting the elements, he has written two sequences r1,r2,…,rn
 and b1,b2,…,bm
. The sequence r
 consisted of all red elements of a
 in the order they appeared in a
; similarly, the sequence b
 consisted of all blue elements of a
 in the order they appeared in a
 as well.

Unfortunately, the original sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the sequences r
 and b
. He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there are multiple ways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that maximizes the value of

f(a)=max(0,a1,(a1+a2),(a1+a2+a3),…,(a1+a2+a3+⋯+an+m))

Help Monocarp to calculate the maximum possible value of f(a)
.

### Input
The first line contains one integer t
 (1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of four lines.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n
 (1≤n≤100
).

The second line contains n
 integers r1,r2,…,rn
 (−100≤ri≤100
).

The third line contains one integer m
 (1≤m≤100
).

The fourth line contains m
 integers b1,b2,…,bm
 (−100≤bi≤100
).

### Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible value of f(a)
.
