# A. Flipping Game

### Limit
time limit per test: 1 second

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### Problem
Iahub got bored, so he invented a game to be played on paper.

He writes n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and flips all values ak for which their positions are in range [i, j] (that is i ≤ k ≤ j). Flip the value of x means to apply operation x = 1 - x.

The goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.

### Input
The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). In the second line of the input there are n integers: a1, a2, ..., an. It is guaranteed that each of those n values is either 0 or 1.

### Output
Print an integer — the maximal number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move.
